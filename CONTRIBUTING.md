# Contributing to this project

The Mercurial repository is hosted here
https://foss.heptapod.net/graphics/plot-covid19-fr.

Why not a Git repository on Github? Because I think monopoly and uniformity are
bad for open-source and versioning. And because as a user, I really prefer
Mercurial over Git ðŸ˜‹

To submit some changes via a Merge Request, you don't need to fork the project!
The first step is to get the developer role on
https://foss.heptapod.net/graphics/plot-covid19-fr (ask for this
[here](https://foss.heptapod.net/graphics/plot-covid19-fr/-/issues/1)) and then
you can follow [this Heptapod tutorial on how to submit Merge
Requests](https://heptapod.net/pages/quick-start-guide.html).
